ToDos:

Need user login page (learn more about React Context Api for this)
Create user object/state consist of userId, password, saved recipes

Create database for saved recipes

Maybe use MealDBApi with Jer's recipe scraper to already have database of public recipes

Have a meal planning section with a 5-7 days of recipes

Search recipes by catagory (ex: breakfast, lunch, etc..), name, ingredient 


search needs to display all recipes that match the searach criteria. this is why we set filtered recipes so we have an array of all matching 
recipes that we display in the tiles instead of showing the db of recipes


look up minimal react router for simpler router solution
